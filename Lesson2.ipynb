    "### Web Scraping\n",
    "Web scraping is a method used to extract data from websites. This technique is useful when there is a large amount of data on a website that is not readily available in a downloadable format. Python provides several libraries to perform web scraping, the most popular ones being BeautifulSoup and Scrapy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will demonstrate how to scrape the episode data for 'Grey's Anatomy' from a Fandom website using BeautifulSoup and requests. The goal is to collect the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number in series\n",
    "- Number in season\n",
    "- Title\n",
    "- Original air date\n",
    "- U.S. viewers (millions)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Web scraping must be performed in compliance with the website's terms of service. Always check the website's `robots.txt` file and terms of service to ensure that you are allowed to scrape their data.\n"

The long mythologised John Lennon demo was first worked on in February 1995 by Paul, George and Ringo as part of The Beatles Anthology project but it remained unfinished, partly because of the impossible technological challenges involved in working with the vocal John had recorded on tape in the 1970s. For years it looked like the song could never be completed. But in 2022 there was a stroke of serendipity.

I travelled to Nashville to complete this and had the pleasure of working with the legend Darius Rucker. I'm still in shock. Share this with everyone and anyone and let's make an impact with music FOR THE PEOPLE spread BY THE PEOPLE. Somebody out there needs this.

This is the most excited I've ever felt about a collab. It was absolutely legendary to work with Darius Rucker.  Thank you all for continuing to allow me to use my platform to make an IMPACT! All the support is appreciated and not taken for granted. I'm excited to go to war with this one and watch it spread and create healthy conversation. 2023 IS NOT OVER!! SO MUCH MORE ON THE WAY!!! I promise to continue to put my all into creating pieces of work we can all be proud of and carry throughout life. LIKE, COMMENT, SHARE and let's continue to spark minds and be the change we wish to see in the world. Much love! This is MUSIC FOR THE PEOPLE!!!\"\n",

    "## Ottenere una chiave API per YouTube\n",
    "\n",
    "Per ottenere una chiave API per le API di YouTube, devi seguire alcuni passaggi che coinvolgono l'utilizzo della Google Cloud Console. Ecco una guida passo dopo passo:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accedi a Google Cloud Console**: Visita [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) e accedi con il tuo account Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Crea un Nuovo Progetto**: Una volta nella console, crea un nuovo progetto cliccando su \"Seleziona un progetto\" e poi su \"Nuovo Progetto\". Assegna un nome al tuo progetto e clicca su \"Crea\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Seleziona il Progetto Creato**: Assicurati che il progetto appena creato sia selezionato nella console.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Abilita le YouTube Data API**: Vai alla sezione \"API e Servizi\" > \"Libreria\", cerca \"YouTube Data API v3\", e clicca su di essa. Poi clicca su \"Abilita\" per attivare l'API per il tuo progetto.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Crea le Credenziali**: Dopo aver abilitato le API, vai a \"Credenziali\" nel menu a sinistra. Clicca su \"Crea credenziali\" e seleziona \"Chiave API\". Questo genererà una nuova chiave API.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Restrizioni della Chiave API (Opzionale)**: Dopo aver creato la chiave API, è consigliabile impostare delle restrizioni per migliorare la sicurezza. Puoi limitare l'uso della chiave API a specifiche API (come YouTube Data API) e/o limitare i referrer (indirizzi web) che possono utilizzare la chiave.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Copia la Tua Chiave API**: Una volta generata, copia la tua chiave API. Sarà questa la chiave da utilizzare nelle tue richieste alle API di YouTube.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Conserva la Chiave in Modo Sicuro**: Assicurati di conservare la tua chiave API in un luogo sicuro e non condividerla pubblicamente, in quanto può essere utilizzata per accedere a servizi Google a tuo nome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ricorda che l'utilizzo delle API di Google, inclusa quella di YouTube, è soggetto a limiti di quota e, in alcuni casi, a costi. Assicurati di familiarizzare con queste restrizioni per evitare costi inaspettati o interruzioni del servizio. Puoi monitorare e gestire l'uso delle tue API nella Google Cloud Console."
