    "### Web Scraping\n",
    "Web scraping is a method used to extract data from websites. This technique is useful when there is a large amount of data on a website that is not readily available in a downloadable format. Python provides several libraries to perform web scraping, the most popular ones being BeautifulSoup and Scrapy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will demonstrate how to scrape the episode data for 'Grey's Anatomy' from a Fandom website using BeautifulSoup and requests. The goal is to collect the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number in series\n",
    "- Number in season\n",
    "- Title\n",
    "- Original air date\n",
    "- U.S. viewers (millions)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Web scraping must be performed in compliance with the website's terms of service. Always check the website's `robots.txt` file and terms of service to ensure that you are allowed to scrape their data.\n"

    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an important step in any data analysis process. It allows us to understand the data, find patterns and anomalies, and form hypotheses based on the features of the data.\n",

    "`pandas-profiling` is a library that creates a detailed report for a given DataFrame. It's a great tool for EDA because it automatically computes a lot of useful information that would otherwise require a significant amount of manual work. This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Descriptive statistics for each column\n",
    "- Correlations between variables\n",
    "- Histograms of the distributions of variables\n",
    "- Detection of missing values, and much more.\n",

    "**Note**: The `pandas-profiling` library needs to be installed in your Python environment. You can install it using `!pip install pandas-profiling` in a Jupyter Notebook cell.\n"
